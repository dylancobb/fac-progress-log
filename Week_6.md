## Guidance
Answer the following questions considering the [learning outcomes for this week](https://learn.foundersandcoders.com/course/syllabus/developer/full-stack-app/learning-outcomes/).
Make sure to record evidence of your processes. You can use code snippets, screenshots or any other material to support your answers.

Do not fill in the feedback section. The Founders and Coders team will update this with feedback on your progress.

## Assessment
 ### 1. Show evidence of a learning outcome you have achieved this week.
> **Learn new technology from external resources/documentation**  
> I learned about React's Context API and server vs. client components in Next 13 by reading the documentation (https://react.dev/learn/passing-data-deeply-with-context and https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/client-components respectively)

 ### 2. Show an example of a learning outcome you have struggled with and/or would like to re-visit.
> **Learn the fundamental concepts in serverless architecture**
> Reading the provided article on serverless functions didn't feel like enough for things to click just yet. I'd like to try actually using them soon.

## Feedback
> Beth
  
> Well done for using the official documentation as a resource. This will definitely come in handy in the future!

> Youâ€™re right about needing hands-on experience to fully understand serverless architecture. I would suggest a very small project with a simple serverless function using AWS Lambda. You can ask chatgpt to provide you with a short mock-up.
