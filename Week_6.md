## Assessment
 ### 1. Show evidence of a learning outcome you have achieved this week.
> **Learn new technology from external resources/documentation**  
> I learned about React's Context API and server vs. client components in Next 13 by reading the documentation (https://react.dev/learn/passing-data-deeply-with-context and https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/client-components respectively)

 ### 2. Show an example of a learning outcome you have struggled with and/or would like to re-visit.
> **Learn the fundamental concepts in serverless architecture**
> Reading the provided article on serverless functions didn't feel like enough for things to click just yet. I'd like to try actually using them soon.
